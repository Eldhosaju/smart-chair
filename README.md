#PROBLEM STATEMENT :
Aiding Handicapped people
#IDEA :
Many people are suffering of temporary or permanent disabilities due to illnesses or
accidents. For cases of difficult or impossible walking, the use of a wheelchair is
becoming essential. Manual or electric wheelchairs are satisfying most of the low and
medium level disability case where patients can use the wheelchair independently.
However, in severe cases, it is difficult or impossible to use wheelchairs independently.
In such cases wheelchair users often lack independent mobility and rely on somebody
else to handle the wheelchair. Researchers involved in wheelchair are aiming at
designing smart wheelchairs to solve such problems. This paper is to review the recent
studies on smart wheelchair systems. It aims to evaluate the current available
technologies and to discuss new future directions for our ongoing research project.
Rehabilitation devices have been an integral part of the differently-abled people’s life
since time immemorial. This paper describes the design of a smart, motorized, voice
controlled wheelchair using embedded system. Proposed design supports voice
activation system for physically differently abled persons incorporating manual
operation. A dependent user recognition voice system has been integrated in this
wheelchair. The wheelchair has also been developed to work on movement of
accelerometer which will help the person whose limbs are not working. Accelerometer
can be attached to the physically disabled person’s head which he can easily move. It
has also has a provision of joystick for disabled person who can easily move.
#WORKING :
A smart wheelchair can restore autonomy to patients with sensori-motor disabilities by
enabling them to move around freely without depending on the caregivers. The
objective of a smart wheelchair is to reduce user effort in controlling the wheelchair and
to ensure safety during movement. In this paper, our focus is to design and develop a
smart wheelchair using inexpensive hardware and open-source software so as to make
it affordable to a larger section of the target population, particularly in developing
nations.
The user can control the wheelchair using three interfaces namely, Joystick,
Accelerometer and Microphone. Accelerometer is used to detect head-tilt which can be
used for turning the wheelchair. Microphone is used for controlling the wheelchair
through discrete voice commands. The software and hardware architecture of the
platform is described in detail and experiments are performed to demonstrate the
usability of the platform.
